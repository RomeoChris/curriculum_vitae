                                <p>I was born on a Tuesday evening, at a hospital in a riverine community surrounded by lush green, windy environments and the Atlantic ocean a few miles away from me. My parents were hardworking secondary school teachers, people who instilled strong values and a love of learning in me from a young age. My grandparents were a mix of; a Berlin-trained medical doctor, primary school teacher, highway maintenance officer, and a hardworking housewife respectively.<br><br>
                                While growing up, I was an avid reader and spent hours alone, lost in books and reading newspapers. I particularly loved Mathematics. This, because my dad would return everyday from a busy schedule, as a Secondary School Principal, to coach me for many hours. Soon, the coaching hours turned into a marathon Q&A session with complex numbers. Thus, I learnt negative and complex numbers quite early in life. I also began dreaming of becoming a genius crafting solutions for the world.<br><br>                                
                                My childhood was filled with sober adventures. Mostly indoor activities, Church activities, travels, and newapapers, whom my graciously dad supplied daily. Despite the early challenge of my parents divorce at age 7, and many obstacles along the way, I remained determined to chase my dreams and made the most of every opportunity that came my way. Looking back on my early life, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences and people that shaped me into the person I am today.</p>

                              <p>Mr Idorenyin Amaunam is a computer scientist who is currently pursuing a PhD at the Brain Computer Interface and Neural Engineering Laboratory, within the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. He also holds several positions, including being a lecturer at Akwa Ibom State University in Nigeria, a graduate laboratory assistant and invigilator at the University of Essex, a sessional tutor at the University of Essex International College, and an affiliate with AiCore in the United Kingdom.
                              <br><br>
                              He specializes in Brain Computer Interfaces, with a particular focus on theoretical and applied machine learning, mutual and transfer learning for assistance and rehabilitation. His current doctoral research is centered around the analysis of acquired brain signals through machine learning algorithms, which can produce a feedback mechanism for rehabilitating and assessing consciousness in individuals with Disorders of Consciousness (DOCs). This mechanism is designed to provide a range of novel solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of individuals.
                              <br><br>
                              Additionally, Mr Idorenyin’s research explores the applicability of deep learning, specifically transfer learning, to Brain Computer applications. This research aims to evaluate the extent to which these techniques can increase or decrease the availability of BCI systems, which are designed to provide necessary solutions.</p>

                                <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of technology(Brain Computer interfaces, Machine Learning) and the society. I am particularly fascinated by the ways in which transfer learning can assist, change and reform the approcah for which acquired brain signals can be analyzed through machine learning algorithms to produce a feedback mechanism for the users. This, to assist the users interact, communicate, form relationships freely and easily with their environments. As a result, I have dedicated my academic and professional career to studying the methods of Brain Computer Interfaces, Machine Learning and ways to improve the social life of the poeple.

                                Over the years, I have explored a range of topics in computing, including computer security, recommender systems and embeddedd sysytem. Always centred at ways to use these methods to help the livelihood of the common man. I am driven by a passion for understanding how technology is shaping our world and the ways in which it is transforming our society for the better and for the worse. My goal is to use this knowledge to inform the development of technology that benefits humanity in meaningful and sustainable ways, produce other young persons that toe this path and help the human race achieve excellence.</p>

                            <p>This paper proposes a switching feature-based model that leverages the needs of both new and existing users for recommendations of tourist locations. In an attempt to solve the cold-start problem, recommendations to new users are implemented with a Bayesian algorithm on supplied demographic data. For existing users, the system switches to the collaborative filtering subsystem, where recommendation results are produced using Pearson correlation computation and offered based on the items in the database. The model was validated with discounted cumulative gain, precision, and recall. A comparative analysis with some existing systems showed a lower mean absolute error. Experimental results obtained from the survey of different categories of users showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</p>

                            <p>Benign, non-malicious computer security practices that employees across the globe participate in can cause organizations serious problems just as much as malicious security acts. Not much research has been done on this aspect of information security management in Nigeria. It is worth noting that studies of cyber threats are readily available. In this study, we focused specifically on counterproductive computer security behaviours (CCSB), which is a growing phenomenon worldwide. Essentially, CCSB is ill-prescribed computer use practices and general information security behaviors that go against the legitimate interests of an organization. In that regard, we collected empirical data from organisational actors (ie, employees) in Nigeria regarding their views on the phenomenon. Subsequently, we ranked their responses on issues we sampled. Discussions on the top five exemplars of CCSB were presented and recommendations for ameliorating these concerns were provided for management. We hope the insights offered by our study will benefit both practice and theory in the area.</p>

                            <p>We live in an age of relentless and accelerating change, driven by demographic, social, and economic evolution. Daily, humans consume the finite natural resources of the planet. Our impact on the planet is increasing through industrialization, urbanization, energy utilization, and waste production. This impact is not without consequences. Levels of pollution are increasing in our environment, with corresponding effects on our health and well-being. Gaseous chemicals are introduced to the atmosphere daily which is harmful to man. Thus, this research work aims to design and construct a microcomputer-based system that senses and reports the environmental air conditions (air quality, temperature, and relative humidity). The readings can be accessed directly on the display screen of the microcomputer or indirectly through an application running on an android-based smartphone, achieved via the aid of Bluetooth technology. The proposed system design and implementation were guided by the waterfall and prototype approaches. This system can be utilized as a tool to ensure safety in environments such as kitchens, laboratories, and offices. The proposed system is simple to use, cost-effective, and location flexible. Experimental results obtained from random and tailored use of the system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</p>

                            <p>Social media allow the creation and interaction of user-created content. Social medium places include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. Students’ casual discussions on social media mirror into their educational experience, mindset, and worry about the learning procedure. Information from such environments can present valuable data to address students’ problems. The impact of students’ academic performance revealed from social media sites requires human analysis or interaction. Several researchers postulate that students spend more time on social media than on their books. Based on this, a multi-label classification algorithm; the naive Bayes multi-label classifier algorithm is applied to parse data manually to determine the number of hours spent by 60 students from five tertiary institutions. This study presents a tactic and outcome that demonstrates how casual social media data can affect positively or negatively a student’s academic pursuit. It was observed that this is highly distinct, and mirrors well the academic achievements of the reported students.</p>
